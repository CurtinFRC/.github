## Who are we?
We are a First Robotics Competition team from Western Australia (WA). Founded in 2013 we were the very first First team in WA and have started a variety of First programs here in WA. Along with ths we have also competed very succesfully in FRC for many years. Most Recently in 2023 we began competing at regionals again after COVID and won the Impact award sending us to Champs. 

## What do we do?
Back when we started our team we also started First Lego League in WA which we have run and grown ever since. In 2021 we started running the West Australian Robotics Playoffs, WARP! In the years since we have grown WARP tremendously starting many teams within WA allowing for a growth of STEM in WA. Going into 2024 we are participating in the 2024 Open Alliance.
